# BGE-ASTCN
Bi-Hemisphere Graph Expert Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Network for EEG Emotion Recognition

EEG emotion recognition via deep learning technologies has long been investigated in the field of affective brain-computer interaction. However, current deep models still have limited capabilities to deal with the spatio-temporal interaction relationships and the intensive individual variability of emotional EEG. To address the issues, this study proposes a Bi-Hemisphere Graph Expert Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Network (BGE-ASTCN): 1) multi-head attention module is designed to extract the multi-group spatio-temporal characteristics of EEG signals while highlighting temporally salient components, 2) on the basis of division of brain regions, bi-hemisphere graph expert module applies to process region-specific EEG representations and attain fine-grained spatio-temporal EEG features, 3) domain adversarial training module utilizes the gradient reversal layer to confuse the distributions of deep EEG features between training and testing subjects in order to mitigate the influence of individual variability. BGE-ASTCN jointly optimizes focal-based classification loss with cross-entropy-based domain loss during model training, effectively balancing subject generalization and task-related discrimination. The experimental results on public emotional EEG datasets indicate that BGE-ASTCN can successfully capture the individual-unrelated spatio-temporal EEG representations and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both cross-subject and within-subject experiments with the classification accuracies up to 91.12% & 98.17% for SEED dataset and 78.18% & 89.15% for SEED-IV dataset.
